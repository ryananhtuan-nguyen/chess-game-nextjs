This is a very simple chess-game built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Installation

  - Clone the repo
  - Run 
  ```bash
  npm install
  # or your own package manager command
  ```

## Getting Started

  - First, run the build for better experience:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  # or your own package manager command
  ```

  - Run the development server
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tech Stack Highlights:

  - OOP in typescript
  - Manage complex state with useReducer

## Current issues:
  - The game logic is not fully implemented yet. Missing:
    + Checkmate
    + Castling

## What's next? 

  - socket.io for real-time update and multi-player.
  - (optional) a database for user data.
  - (optional) rebuild using a database instead of classes
